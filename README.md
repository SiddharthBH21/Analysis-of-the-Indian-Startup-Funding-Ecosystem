# Project Overview
Harold is a very traditional financial money manager from the USA, investing almost exclusively in the US. After the US economys growth trajectory looked bleak and the FED predicted GDP growth to linger below a mere 2% annually, his clients have been running from our investment products. Where are they all going? After booking a tee time with one of our long-time clients, he heard some adolescents with smartphones talking about the start-up scene in India. There were wild tales about startups with valuations beyond $1B, called unicorns. Apparently, there was not a hint of a slowing economy over there. Is it time to go international? After multiple people confirmed the start-up hype in India, he concluded that it is time to get ourselves a snapshot of what is going on in India. Who is investing? Where are they investing? And most importantly, which companies are they investing in?

As a team, we perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and finally, create a visualization in Tableau. Also, we chose the Indian Startup Funding dataset collected from multiple sources because of the varied types of funding covered, the sizable number of observations, and the time coverage from 2015 until May 2022, including the Covid-19 phase.

Conclusion
The startup ecosystem in India has taken the spotlight in recent times and has caught the attention of the public and investors alike. Investors have been pouring their money into these various Indian startups in the hope of gaining spectacular returns. Through our detailed analysis, we give you a business overview on the companies funded, different stages of funding, demographics of funding, industry verticals which received funding and information about investors. From 2015 to 2020 in India, there were 1000 companies that recieved funding in the form of private equity, 748 companies in Seed stage, 110 companies in pre-seed stage, and 29 companies in debt Funding. Private Equity Funds primarily invest in mature companies characterized by stable and predictable cashflows, therefore a high number of PE deals realtive to venture/seed funding indicates that the indian economy is progressively seen as advanced and stable. Further analysis about private equity strategy below confirms this.

As we continue to explore, we see that Softbank Group invested most amount in USD and Sequoia Capital invested into most numbers of Companies in India. Both Softbank and Sequoia are behemoths in both venture and private equity investing. Having industry leaders pave the way in india indicates high attractiveness and deal value.

Across 2015 to 2017, Flipkart is the major leader in funding of the eCommerce industry vertical, which received 6 times of fundings with total of $4,759,700,000.

The huge investment amounts into Flipkart makes eCommerce become the highest funded sector across 2015-2020, with a total investment inflow amount of $7,967,145,717.

Because the eCommerce sector was mainly boosted by Flipkart, we cannot conclude that eCommerece has most interest among investors.

Accounting for the bias of Flipkart we see that technology and consumer internet have the two largest investment amounts of industry verticles. Additionally, especially during COVID-19, the education-technology sector (e-Tech) took the lead.

When we continue analysis the descriptive statistics by reviewing the difference between founding year and funding year, we explored that Duroflex, a mattress company the oldest company in our dataset, provides a valuable snapshot of how private equity funds perceive the Indian economy. Throughout the 90s and 00s, mattress firm buyouts have been some of the most stable return drivers for funds in the US because of stable and predictable birth and death rates. Seeing a private equity fund replicating 90s and 00s PE strategy from 2015 to 2020 by investing and continuing to lever and delever the same company shows that they are viewing the investment environment as stable and profitable.

As the conclusion, acquisitions of companies like Duroflex show that PE funds are increasingly trying to find opportunities of arbitrage in India.

In conclusion, we recommend Harold to consider employing Analysts and Experts to explore upcoming companies in Bangalore, the National Capital Region (Delhi), and Mumbai. These companies can be within the industry verticals of Consumer Internet, eCommerce, and Technology. The most sought after companies are fast growing and maturing companies in the seed funding and private equity stage.
